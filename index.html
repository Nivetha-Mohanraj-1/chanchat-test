  <h1>The Whispering Cats of Elowen Forest</h1>
  <p>The Whispering Cats are a mysterious feline species found only in Elowen Forest, a mist-covered woodland said to exist beyond the northern ridge of the Valley of Hollow Winds.</p>

  <h2>Appearance</h2>
  <p>These cats have translucent fur that shimmers like moonlight and eyes that reflect colors no human has ever named. They rarely leave pawprints, even on soft earth.</p>

  <h2>Behavior</h2>
  <p>Whispering Cats do not meow like ordinary felines. Instead, they emit soft, melodic murmurs at twilight that resemble fragments of forgotten lullabies. Locals believe the cats are able to mimic the last words spoken near them before nightfall.</p>

  <h2>Habits</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>They sleep curled around tree roots, often in pairs.</li>
    <li>They are drawn to wind chimes and will gather beneath them during storms.</li>
    <li>They vanish completely during solar eclipses and reappear only after the third moonrise.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Legends</h2>
  <p>One tale claims that a Whispering Cat once guided a lost painter to safety and whispered a color into his ear that no one else could see. The painter vanished a year later, leaving behind canvases that shimmer and hum softly in the dark.</p>
